## Subagent Safety

Subagents (Task tool) cannot surface permission prompts, authentication errors, or user questions to the main conversation. They block silently, appearing to hang.

**Subagent-safe operations** (delegate freely):
- Code reading, analysis, and review
- File searching and pattern matching
- Context7 documentation lookups
- Local file writes within the worktree
- Running builds and tests

**Main-agent-only operations** (never delegate):
- `AskUserQuestion` — user interaction deadlocks in subagents. This also means reference skills that use `AskUserQuestion` (e.g. `attachments`) must only be invoked from the main agent
- `git push`, `git fetch`, `git pull` — require auth tokens
- `gh` commands — require auth tokens
- PR creation, ticket updates, comment replies — require auth tokens
- Any operation that may trigger a permission prompt
