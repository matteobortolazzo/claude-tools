# ccflow — Claude Code Workflow Plugin

Ticket refinement and automated implementation pipeline for GitHub.

## What it does

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/ccflow:configure` | Interactive project setup: tech stack, sandboxing, MCP/LSP servers |
| `/ccflow:refine <ticket-id>` | Iterative ticket refinement until it's ready for planning |
| `/ccflow:design <ticket-id \| description>` | Interactive design reasoning and `.pen` file creation using Pencil |
| `/ccflow:implement <ticket-id>` | Full pipeline: plan, test, implement, refactor, security review, code review, lessons, PR |
| `/ccflow:address-review <pr-number>` | Address PR review comments — fetch, evaluate, fix, reply, push, re-request review |
| `/ccflow:sync` | Pull latest main, rebase active worktrees, prune stale remotes, clean up merged branches |

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Claude Code** CLI installed and authenticated
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`): for GitHub Issues and PRs — [install](https://cli.github.com/)
- **Node.js**: only required if using Context7 (MCP server for live documentation lookup)

### Optional: LSP Servers

LSP servers provide real-time diagnostics (type errors, unused variables, dead code) during implementation. Install any that match your stack:

| Stack | Server | Install Command |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | typescript-language-server | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| Python | pyright | `pip install pyright` or `npm install -g pyright` |
| Rust | rust-analyzer | See [rust-analyzer docs](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation) |
| C# / .NET | csharp-ls | `dotnet tool install --global csharp-ls` |
| Go | gopls | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |

Run `/ccflow:configure` to detect and enable LSP servers for your project.

### Authentication

```bash
gh auth login
```
The `gh` CLI stores credentials in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`. It also respects `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` env vars as a fallback for non-interactive environments.

### Sandbox support (Linux / WSL2)
Sandboxing provides OS-level filesystem and network isolation for autonomous execution. It requires:
- **bubblewrap** (`bwrap`): `sudo apt install bubblewrap` (or `sudo pacman -S bubblewrap`)
- **socat**: `sudo apt install socat` (or `sudo pacman -S socat`)

macOS sandbox support is built into Claude Code and requires no extra packages.

## Installation

### Via marketplace (recommended)

```bash
# Register the repo as a marketplace (works with private repos too)
claude plugin marketplace add matteobortolazzo/claude-tools

# Install the plugin (persists across sessions)
claude plugin install ccflow
```

To update later: `claude plugin update ccflow`

### Manual (per-session)

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/ccflow
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start Claude Code (plugin loads automatically if installed via marketplace)
claude

# 2. Configure the project (one-time setup)
/ccflow:configure

# 3. Refine a ticket (optional but recommended)
/ccflow:refine 12345

# 4. Design a ticket (optional — for frontend/UI tickets)
/ccflow:design 12345

# 5. Implement a ticket
/ccflow:implement 12345
```

## Working from your phone

ccflow skills (`/refine`, `/implement`, `/design`) are **interactive** — they ask clarifying questions and iterate. Triggering them via one-shot mechanisms (GitHub Actions, webhook, `claude --print`) drops all conversation state after each turn, which defeats their whole design.

**The fit-for-purpose answer is SSH + tmux**, which you probably already have:

1. **On laptop**: keep Claude Code running in a named tmux window (e.g. `tmux new -As ccflow`).
2. **Expose the laptop to your phone** via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (or any VPN/SSH-accessible network).
3. **On phone**: install an SSH client — [Blink](https://blink.sh) (iOS), [Termius](https://termius.com) (iOS/Android), or [Termux](https://termux.dev) (Android).
4. **From phone**: SSH into your laptop, `tmux attach -t ccflow`, and type `/ccflow:refine 42` — you get the full interactive experience. Close the app; tmux keeps the session alive; reconnect anytime.

**Why this beats GH-comment or remote bots:**
- Real conversation state — skills ask questions, you answer, they proceed. Just like your desk.
- `/clear`, `/compact`, and every other Claude Code feature works normally.
- No new code to maintain, no webhook infra, no session-resume plumbing.
- Browse issues in the GH mobile app; trigger skills via SSH. Two apps, zero friction.

### What `/ccflow:configure` creates

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md              # (or in .claude/ — user's choice during configure)
├── .claudeignore          # Files tracked by git but excluded from Claude's context
├── .claude/
│   ├── config.json        # ccflow configuration (includes claudeMdLocation)
│   ├── settings.json      # Sandbox, permissions, and allowed domains
│   └── rules/
│       ├── lessons-learned.md   # Captured mistakes for future prevention
│       └── <stack-rules>.md     # Stack-specific coding rules
└── .worktrees/            # Git worktrees for feature branches (gitignored)
```

### Monorepo Support

For monorepos, `/ccflow:configure` detects projects automatically and creates a **progressive disclosure** structure — project-specific context only loads when Claude accesses files in that subtree, saving tokens.

**Three-tier strategy:**

| Tier | Mechanism | Loading | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Root | `CLAUDE.md` at repo root | Eager | Repo-wide conventions, projects table, critical rules |
| Project | `packages/api/CLAUDE.md` etc. | Lazy (on file access) | Stack, build/test commands, project conventions |
| Global Rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Eager | Lessons learned, testing philosophy, security, git workflow |

**Monorepo file structure:**

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md                  # Root — projects table + critical rules (eager)
├── .claudeignore              # Files tracked by git but excluded from Claude's context
├── packages/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── CLAUDE.md          # Per-project — stack, build/test (lazy)
│   └── web/
│       └── CLAUDE.md          # Per-project — stack, build/test (lazy)
├── .claude/
│   ├── config.json            # ccflow configuration (includes isMonorepo + projects)
│   ├── settings.json          # Sandbox, permissions, and allowed domains
│   └── rules/
│       ├── lessons-learned.md        # Repo-wide lessons (eager)
│       ├── lessons-learned-api.md    # Per-project lessons (eager)
│       ├── lessons-learned-web.md    # Per-project lessons (eager)
│       └── <stack-rules>.md          # Stack-specific coding rules (eager)
└── .worktrees/
```

Per-project lessons stay in `.claude/rules/` (eager) because lessons are the highest-value context — the token cost of a few extra KB is outweighed by preventing repeated mistakes across project boundaries.

## Implementation Pipeline

When you run `/ccflow:implement <ticket-id>`, the pipeline executes these phases:

1. **Plan** — Planner agent analyzes the ticket and proposes an implementation plan (waits for your approval).
2. **Worktree Setup** — Creates an isolated git worktree for the feature branch
3. **Test First (Red)** — Implementer agent writes failing tests
4. **Implement (Green)** — Implementer agent makes tests pass
5. **Refactor** — Implementer agent simplifies and cleans up
6. **Security Review** — Security reviewer agent checks for OWASP vulnerabilities
7. **Code Review** — Code reviewer agent does a final PR-style review
8. **Capture Lessons** — Lessons collector extracts mistakes into lessons-learned
9. **Create PR** — Rebases on latest main, commits, pushes, and creates a pull request

## Ticket Splitting

When a ticket is sized M or L during `/ccflow:refine`, the skill suggests splitting it into numbered child tickets (e.g., "(1/3)", "(2/3)", "(3/3)") with explicit dependency ordering — which children can be implemented in parallel and which are sequential. Each child references the parent in its body and the parent tracks all children in a "Child Tickets" checklist with dependencies. When `/ccflow:implement` creates a PR for the last open child, it auto-closes the parent alongside the child.

## Architecture

The plugin uses specialized agents with isolated contexts:

| Agent | Role | Model | Permission Mode |
|-------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **planner** | Analyzes tickets, produces implementation plans | inherit | plan (read-only) |
| **implementer** | TDD: writes tests first, then implementation | inherit | acceptEdits |
| **security-reviewer** | OWASP-focused security review | sonnet | plan (read-only) |
| **code-reviewer** | PR-style quality review | sonnet | plan (read-only) |
| **lessons-collector** | Extracts mistakes into lessons-learned | haiku | acceptEdits |

External integrations use the `gh` CLI rather than MCP servers, keeping permissions simple and avoiding token overhead. Optional MCP servers: Context7 (live documentation lookup) and Pencil (design file creation via `/ccflow:design`).

## Known Limitations

- **SSH git remotes + sandbox**: The sandbox uses `allowedDomains` for network filtering, which works with HTTPS but not SSH. If you have an SSH remote (`git@github.com:...`), `git push` will fail inside the sandbox. **Recommended**: switch to HTTPS remotes (`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git`), or push manually when prompted.
- **New repos with no commits**: `git worktree add` requires at least one commit. The pipeline handles this automatically by creating an initial commit if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### `git push` fails inside sandbox
The sandbox blocks SSH connections. Options:
1. Switch to HTTPS: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git`
2. Push manually when the pipeline prompts you
3. Disable sandbox in `.claude/settings.json` (not recommended)

### `git worktree add` fails with "not a valid reference"
Your repo has no commits. The pipeline should handle this automatically. If it doesn't, create an initial commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: initial commit" --allow-empty`

### Sandbox permissions errors on Linux
Ensure bubblewrap and socat are installed:
```bash
sudo apt install bubblewrap socat   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo pacman -S bubblewrap socat     # Arch
```

### GitHub CLI not authenticated
Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts. Verify with `gh auth status`.

### Agent prompts for file edit permissions
This should not happen with the default settings. Verify `.claude/settings.json` includes `Write(*)` and `Edit(*)` in `permissions.allow`. Running `/ccflow:implement` will auto-detect missing permissions and offer to fix them, or you can re-run `/ccflow:configure` to regenerate settings.
